# BalckBerry OpenRouter Chatbot Client

This is an AI Chatbot client using OpenRouter for the Blackberry Passport. Although it was designed for the BlackBerry Passport but should also work on other devices.

Simply enter your OpenRouter API key, select the model you want to interact with and start asking questions.

It works in a similar way to the other BB chatbot clients I have built in which the state of the chat is stored in the BlackBerry Browser (which has its limits). Chats can also be cleared as needed.
